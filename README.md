# Telecom Client Diversity and Inclusion Analysis

## Project Description:

This project aims to address the slow progress of gender balance at the executive management level in a telecom client's Human Resources department. As part of the PwC virtual experience program, the project focuses on leveraging data analytics to identify insights and provide recommendations for improving diversity and inclusion within the organization.

## Project Steps:

### 1. Data Exploration: 

The project begins with a thorough exploration of the provided dataset to gain an understanding of its structure and contents.

### 2. Data Transformation and Cleaning:
This step involves cleaning the data by removing irrelevant sheets and mapping essential attributes for analysis. The dataset is refined to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### 3. KPI Definition: 
Relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are defined based on stakeholder requirements and a comprehensive understanding of the data. The KPIs are aligned with areas such as hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover.

### 4. Measure Calculation using DAX: 
Measures that are crucial for each KPI are calculated using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) in Power BI. These measures provide meaningful insights into the selected KPIs.

### 5.Visualization: 
The project includes the creation of five dashboards, each dedicated to a specific KPI. These dashboards present visual representations of the KPI data. Additionally, a welcome page summarizes the key findings from the visualizations.

Provide mentorship and leadership development programs specifically targeted at women employees to enhance their chances of advancement.
Implement transparent and objective performance evaluation criteria to ensure fair promotion decisions.

### Retention and Turnover:

Conduct exit interviews to understand the reasons behind high turnover rates, especially among men at the executive level.
Address any identified issues related to work environment, career development opportunities, or work-life balance that may contribute to turnover.
Develop initiatives to create an inclusive and supportive work culture that encourages employee retention and engagement.

### Performance Evaluation:

Review the performance evaluation process to ensure objectivity and fairness, considering potential biases that may affect ratings.
Provide training to managers on unconscious bias and promote awareness of gender-related biases in performance assessments.
Implement regular feedback mechanisms to support employee growth and improvement.

### Demographic Representation:

Continuously monitor and analyze the demographic composition of the workforce to identify potential areas of underrepresentation and take proactive steps to address them.
Encourage diversity and inclusion initiatives within the organization, promoting a culture that values and appreciates different perspectives and backgrounds.
